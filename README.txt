This is my first project with the application of HTML & CSS knowledge in practice. I spent about 7 hours on it and I think it was pretty good for the first time. I made a responsive design, some basic animations, a nice gradient for the background, a slider carousel and a light/dark theme. The only thing I had serious problems with was the burger menu in the phone version. Thanks to the internet for helping me solve that :D
